## Technical Assignment

The code below is a User class that takes a name and date of birth.

Your task is to implement the age and next_birthday methods such that they return the correct result for today.

Spend at most 45 minutes on the task. The bonus question is hard and you can still pass without making it work.

If you would prefer to use a different programming language you're very welcome to! Please provide an equivalent User class and test suite along with instructions for how to run it.

### How to run the code

- Clone or Download the github repository from the Terminal
```
  git clone https://github.com/jarasmar/Tech_Test_Birthdays.git
```
- Jump into the repository
```
  cd Tech_Test_Birthdays
```
- Run the following command to see the test output
```
  ruby tech_test.rb
```
